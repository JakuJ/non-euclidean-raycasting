# Non-Euclidean Raycasting

WORK IN PROGRESS

Working:
* Naive raycasting
* 2D level view
* Pseudo-3D first person view
* MVC pattern to allow multiple views (see the screenshot)

Move with WSAD, run with left Shift, look around with your mouse. Change views / level size in the setup function.

## Screenshot of the current version:
